\section{Implications and Recommendations}
Here we analyse the implications of using IAIDSTs in talent identification. We first look at the strengths and limitations of post-hoc explanations and prescribe appropriate use cases for these types of IAIDSTs. Second, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of intrinsically interpretable models, including purpose-built models, and make similar prescriptions. Finally, we distil our insights in purpose-building IAIDSTs for TI professionals and extrapolate to general recommendations.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
We note the limitations of this research method. We examine first limitations of individual case studies and note how other methodologies might address these limitations. We then raise concerns about our research's external validity, especially with regard to our recommendations and prescriptions. We address these concerns and note ways in which this research should not be used. Finally, we highlight areas in which researchers may continue this work or expand upon it.
