\chapter{\label{ch:usingxai}Using Post-Hoc Explainable AI to Identify Talent: Explaining an Applicant Scoring Algorithm with Shapley Values}

\minitoc

We develop a SHAP-based procedure for explaining the decisions made by an applicant scoring algorithm used in a talent investment organisation. We take into account the original functions of SHAP explanations and provide a contract for the intended use case of our procedure: to systematically reveal insights about the underlying algorithm itself, help us better understand counterintuitive results, and instruct us on where this algorithm should be modified. We explore decisions made by the talent investment organisation and analyse the applicant scoring algorithm using the SHAP tool. We discover... Finally, we discuss the potential for extending this tool to use in decision-making and note strategies to combat mis-calibrated trust.

\section{Explaining Applicant Resumes with Highlighting and Blinding}
We develop a white-box explanation algorithm for highlighting the resumes of job applicants and scoring them. We use only the highlights themselves, opting for an evaluative AI approach, and provide a contract for the intended use case of our algorithm. We then implement this tool in the hiring process of an organisation and conduct a field study on its impact on hiring decision-making. We discover...
