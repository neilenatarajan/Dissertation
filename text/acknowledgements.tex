I would like to thank my advisors Reuben Binns and Nigel Shadbolt: Reuben, for his constant dedication to his students and willingness to run with any idea I came up with; Nigel, for his clear framing and pointed critiques. I would also like to thank my colleagues in Oxford Computer Science's HCAI theme, with special thanks to Sruthi, Ulrik, Jun, and Thomas. I would like to thank my family for their support, emotionally and intellectually, and my friends for my sanity.
