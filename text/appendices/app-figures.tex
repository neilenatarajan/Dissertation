Because the applicant pool was international, these specific item types were chosen because they rely minimally on knowledge of english. In the program's implementation, each applicant saw 5 questions of each type.}\label{fig:icar_items}

Shapes within the grid serve as different obstacles and mechanisms for navigating the level. How each obstacle and mechanism work are not explained to the player, as part of the test is about discovering \emph{how} they work. Multidimensional data from the game are collected and aggregated to give players a percentile score.
