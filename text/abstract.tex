Artificially Intelligent (AI) systems are being implemented across a variety of fields, including the particularly sensitive field of Talent Identification (TI). With these implementations, existing ethical challenges are exacerbated and new challenges are posed. Here we contend that careful implementation of Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (IAI) and Decision Support Tools (DSTs) can address existing challenges, avoid new challenges, and improve TI professionals' decision-making.

We first analyse the existing state of AI, IAI, and DSTs, and their applications to TI problems. We define terms related to IAIDSTs and examine preconceptions about what makes specific IAIDSTs well-suited to this purposes. We then look at open challenges in TI, including but not limited to those introduced or exacerbated by the use of AI in TI. Finally, we make a note of other systems designed to solve similar problems in TI.

We move on to examine three particular challenges introduced or exacerbate by AI systems in TI: decision tool interpretability; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); and applicant usage of generative AI. We examine these challenges through series of five case studies case studies wherein different types of IAIDSTs are used to address different challenges in TI. In each case, we either develop or examine an IAIDST, note the motivation for its inclusion in a TI pipeline, and examine the potential pitfalls in its implementation. We then conclude when and how each IAIDST should be used to best serve the purpose it was introduced for while mitigating risks of implementation.

Finally, we draw insights from these studies and present prescriptions for how and when one might use the IAIDSTs discussed. We extrapolate these insights into more recommendations for designing and implementing IAIDSTs in TI. We note three design recommendations that appear throughout our studies: Human Centrism, Trustworthiness Through Transparency, and Qualitative/Quantitative Balance. We discuss both general and specific design recommendations, and explore the limitations of this approach. We conclude with a discussion of the future of IAIDSTs in TI, and the potential for further research in this area.
