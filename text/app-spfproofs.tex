\section{Proof of Greedy Approximation}
Here, we prove that the greedy approximation method introduced in Algorithm \ref{alg:frontier} for SPF is a $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for our standard class of diversity functions subject to a cardinality constraint.

Recall that a diversity function $f: 2^X -> \mathbb{R}^+$  maps a cohort (a set of applicants) to a ``diversity score'' (a non-negative real number). Here, our applicant pool $X$ is represented as a set with applicants as its members, and possible cohorts $C \subseteq X$ are subsets of $X$. We restrict our analysis to standard diversity functions, which we assert are monotonic ($A \subseteq B -> f(A) \leq f(B)$) and submodular ($A \subseteq B \and x \notin B -> f_A(x) \geq f_B(x)$ (here, $f_S(e) = f(S \cup \{e\}) - f(S)$ denote the marginal gain of adding element $e$ to set $S$) .We demonstrate elsewhere that many common understandings of diversity are represented by standard diversity functions.

We now recreate a proof of Theorem \ref{thm:greedy-approximation} first demonstrated in \cite{nemhauser_analysis_1978}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:greedy-approximation}
    Let $(S_0...S_k)$ be a sequence of sets where $S_0$ is the empty set and $S_{i>0}$ is defined by following Algorithm \ref{alg:frontier}. Further, let $O := argmax_S(f(S) : |S| = k)$ be the set of size $k$ that maximizes $f$. Then $f(S_k) \geq (1 - \frac{1}{e})f(O)$. 
\end{theorem}

\emph{Proof}. Let ${o_1...o_k} = O$ be any ordering of the elements of $O$. Let ${s_i} := S_i - S_{i-1}$ be the element added to $S_{i-1}$ to form $S_i$.

By monotonicity, we have $\forall i . f(O) \leq f(O \cup S_i)$.  We can then write $f(O \cup S_i) = f(O \cup S_i) - f(S_i) + f(S_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \bigl f(S_i \cup {o_1...o_j}) - f(S_i \cup {o_1...o_{j-1}}) \bigr$. I.e., $f(O \cup S_i) = f(O \cup S_i) - f(S_i) + f(S_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{k} f_{S_i \cup {o_1...o_{j-1}}}(o_j)$.

By submodularity, $\forall j \in [1...k] . f_{S_i \cup {o_1...o_{j-1}}}(o_j) \leq f_{s_i}(o_j)$. Thus, $f(O) \leq f(S_i) + k*f_{S_i}(s_{i+1})$. 

Since Algorithm \ref{alg:frontier} guarantees that $\forall e \in X - S_i . f_{S_i}(e) \geq f_{S_i}(e)$, it follows that, at every stage, $f(S_{i+1}) - f(S_i) \geq \frac{1}{k} \bigl f(O) - f(S_i) \bigr$. 

Then induction yields $f(O) - f(S_k) \leq {\bigl 1 - \frac{1}{k} \bigr}^k f(O) \leq \frac{1}{e} f(O)$.
